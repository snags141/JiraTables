    <h1>General Controls</h1>
    <h3>Table Width</h3>
    <p>Specify how wide you want your tables to display in percentages. For example: 100 is default, 300 might be more optimal for tables with a larger amount of content - Play around with different values until you find something that works for you.</p>
    <h3>Units selector</h3>
    <p>Currently the extension only sets values in Percentages, but in future will support exact pixels as a unit.</p>
